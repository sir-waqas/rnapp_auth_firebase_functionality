1. Create the project
2. Create the new App.js in src
3. Create the src/components/common Dir
4. Make a single import statement work by using custom components in index.js dictionary file
5. Make an auth project on firebase console with your gmail account
6. npm install --save firebase
7. Init Firebase in a Lifecycle method and test the app if everything is working fine
8. Create LoginForm.js in the root of components; Not in the common dir -- This will contain our custom controls to create the Login Form UI
9. Import the LoginForm.js in the App.js component so that Index Root of the App can call App.js containing the LoginForm.js
10. Create an Input Custom Control with all the required props in order to customize the control based on our requirements

<!-- Change a Repo -->

git remote set-url origin new.git.url/here

11. Let's Login our User :)
    onPress prop for Button control needs to be configured

    Promises are used for asynchronous actions required in an app
    firebase.auth().signInWith...
    firebase.auth().createUserWith...
    Please remember that password should be atleast 6 chars or else the user creation might fail
    //Helper method onButtonPress() v 1.0() to Login the user
    onButtonPress() {
    const { email, password } = this.state;
    //Firebase mathod to login using userid & password

    //Clear out the Error Message on Every Login Attempt
    this.setState({ error: "" });

    firebase
    .auth()
    .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    .catch(() => {
    firebase
    .auth()
    .createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    .catch(() => {
    this.setState({ error: "Authentication Failed" });
    });
    });
    }

12. Now when the app is working as per our current logic we need to add a spinner to display decent bg process so add a custom component in order to re-use the spinner. Make an Activity Spinner

13. Apply the Spinner on every button click before the content needs to appear. Create a renderButton() method and call it inplace of <CustomButton> component (This is called the conditional rendering of the JSX)
14. Now we need to handle when the Spinner needs to go away.
    Let's create an onLoginSuccess() methhod and do the following:
    Make the loading status false
    Clear the form as values are still visible
    Clear the Error message if it's still appearing
    and call the above method in the onButtonPress() method after every happy flow

15. Now we need to create onLoginFailed() method to do similar items in and bind it when we have a error case

16. Now another conditional rendering case to be handled from the App level; i.e. When user is logged in we need to show logout option rather than LoginForm otherwise by default the signup plus login form has to appear
    firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged()...

17. Use switch case of handle the three loggedIn or loggedOut or something in between on the main form

18. Functionality to Logout

//Summary
Configuration to Connect to Firebase
Handle the TextInput from the Login Form using State in LoginForm
Handle Spinner Login using Conditional Formating of JSX while rendering
Handle Similar Situation of Conditional Formating at AppLevel based on LoggedIn Info
Handle to Logout logic at App Level
